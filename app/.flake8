[flake8]
exclude = 
    migrations,
    __pycache__,
    manage.py,
    settings.py

#it tells to flake 8 to exclude these following directories and files from the linting
#we do migrations because migrations is generated by django.
#__pycache__ doesnt need to be linted because its just caches files automatically
#generated by Python.
#manage.py is just a script included in Django
#settings.py are also generated by Django, so its not necessary to use flake8 on it
